      "\n",
      "A. CONTACT SITUATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Incidental Contact\n",
      "The mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which \n",
      "\n",
      "is incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform \n",
      "normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a \n",
      "player attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to \n",
      "perform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this \n",
      "position.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hand is considered “part of the ball” when it is in contact with the ball. Therefore, \n",
      "contact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Guarding an Opponent\n",
      "In all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires, \n",
      "\n",
      "provided he legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent. If a defensive \n",
      "or offensive player has established a position on the floor and his opponent initiates contact \n",
      "that results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY.\n",
      "\n",
      "During all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed to take a position \n",
      "between his man and the basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "A player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an \n",
